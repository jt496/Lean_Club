# Lean_Club

You will need a GitHub account. If you don't already have one you can sign up for a free account here: https://github.com/

Ideally you should install Lean3 and VScode on your own machine following these instructions: https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html
(Choose the Regular Install link for your system.)

Once installed, open a terminal in the directory where you wish to store Lean project files and run:

    leanproject get jt496/Lean_Club


An alternative is to use Gitpod (and Chrome) via the following link: https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jt496/Lean_Club
